    <h2>What is dance?</h2>
    <h4>- Dance is a form of creative expression through physical movement that includes rhythmic movements that accompany music.<br>
        Historically, dance has been used in celebrations and religious observances. Dance has played an important role in human societies<br> 
        since ancient times and continues to evolve and develop today.<br>
     - Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely<br>
    expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful<br>
    impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important connecting ideas running<br>
    through any consideration of the subject. In dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither<br>
    can exist without the other.</h4>
    <h2>What is the main purpose of dance?</h2>
    <h4> - Dance has always been a part of human culture, rituals and celebrations. Today, most dancing is about recreation and self-expression,<br>
         although it can also be done as a competitive activity. Dancing is an enjoyable way to be more physically active and stay fit.<br>
        - Dance can be broken down into its primary elements: Body, Energy, Space, and Time. It can be easily recalled through the acronym B.E.S.T.<br>
          The body is the mobile instrument of the dancer and helps inform us of what is moving. The body category includes shapes, actions, and whole-body<br>
           and part-body movements.</h4>
